## 📊 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values (Age, Embarked, Fare)
- Dropped Cabin column due to high missing percentage
- Encoded categorical features (Sex, Embarked)

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Selected important features for prediction
- Applied label encoding

### 3️⃣ Model Building
- Used Random Forest Classifier
- Performed train-validation split
- Evaluated using accuracy score
