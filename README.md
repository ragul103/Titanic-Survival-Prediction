# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction | Kaggle ML Competition

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is based on Kaggle’s *Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster* competition.  
The objective was to develop a classification model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck using structured passenger data.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Random Forest Classifier

---

## 📊 Problem Statement
Given passenger attributes such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and family details, build a machine learning model to predict survival outcomes.

---

## 🔎 Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values using median and mode imputation
- Removed high-missing feature (`Cabin`)
- Encoded categorical features (`Sex`, `Embarked`)
- Selected relevant features for modeling

---

## 🤖 Model Development
- Performed train-validation split
- Trained a Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy score
- Generated predictions for Kaggle test dataset

---

## 📈 Results
- **Validation Accuracy:** 82.68%
- **Kaggle Public Leaderboard Score:** 75.35%

The difference between validation and public score highlights real-world generalization challenges.

---

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Importance of proper data cleaning
- Feature encoding techniques
- Model validation vs unseen test data performance
- Avoiding overfitting in classification models

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Feature engineering (Family Size, Title extraction)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Comparison with Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting models
- Cross-validation for better generalization
